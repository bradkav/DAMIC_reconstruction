# DAMIC_reconstruction
Some example code, illustrating how to use WIMpy (with the end-goal being to perform projections/reconstructions for future CCD Dark Matter detectors)

The WIMpy code is here - https://github.com/bradkav/WIMpy_NREFT - with a number of other example notebooks here - https://github.com/bradkav/WIMpy_NREFT/blob/master/Examples/NREFT_example.ipynb. You can download the repository directly, or install with:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bradkav/WIMpy_NREFT
```
